  Buffy is broken down into different modules depending on how you want to
  handle your function calling.

  ## Debounce

  The `Buffy.Debounce` module will wait for a specified amount of time before
  invoking the function. If the function is called again before the time has
  elapsed, the timer will be reset and the function will be called again after
  the specified amount of time.
